#MEME CREATOR
-This is the app where it gives a bunch of meme images where you can edit them with texts you want and finally get your new meme images. The memes data is fetched using an API request.

Running this React app on your local machine involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Before you can run a React app, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your local machine. You can follow the instructions provided in my previous response to install Node.js and npm.

2. **Clone the repository into your local machine:**
   Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can clone the repo using the command-line tool. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx git clone https://github.com/honxsinatra/Meme-Creator-React-App.git

   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   In the same terminal or command prompt, run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and meme Creator React app should open automatically in your default web browser.

4. **Stop the Development Server:**
   To stop the development server and shut down React app when you're finished working on it, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where the server is running. Confirm the termination when prompted.
That's it!
